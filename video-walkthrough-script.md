# Student Productivity App: Prototype Walkthrough

## Introduction
Hello, I'm Cameron Warren, a Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Today, I'll be guiding you through the key features and design decisions behind our team's innovative student productivity application prototype.

## Home Screen
Starting with the Home Screen, we've focused on creating an accessible and intuitive navigation experience. Users can easily access the app's core functionalities - Weekly View, Grades, and Settings - through large, clearly labeled buttons. 

The design philosophy here emphasizes simplicity and clarity. By providing a clean, uncluttered interface, we aim to prevent cognitive overload and empower students to quickly find the information they need.

## Weekly Overview
Moving on to the Weekly Overview screen, we've crafted a comprehensive yet digestible snapshot of the user's academic week. At a glance, students can see their upcoming tasks, events, and deadlines.

The interface allows for seamless drilling down into specific days. By tapping on any day, users can reveal more detailed information about assignments, study sessions, or scheduled activities. This hierarchical information design balances high-level awareness with the ability to dive deeper when necessary.

## Grades Screen
Our Grades screen transforms complex academic performance data into easily understandable visual representations. We've incorporated progress bars and charts that provide immediate insights into assignment performance and overall academic standing.

Color-coded indicators help users quickly interpret their progress. Green might represent high-performing areas, while yellow could signal sections needing improvement. The goal is to transform raw grade data into actionable insights that support students in managing their academic journey.

## Options and Settings
The Settings screen empowers users with customization options. Here, students can manage their account details, adjust application preferences, and access help resources.

We've organized settings logically, ensuring that even less tech-savvy users can personalize their experience without feeling intimidated. Clear labels and grouped settings make navigation intuitive, allowing users to tailor the app to their individual needs.

## Closing
This prototype represents our commitment to creating a user-centered productivity tool for students. Every design decision aims to reduce stress and enhance academic organization, supporting learners in achieving their full potential.

Thank you for joining me on this walkthrough. I'm excited to showcase our team's vision for the future of student productivity applications.
